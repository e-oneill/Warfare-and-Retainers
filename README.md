# Warfare-and-Retainers
A website for managing retainers and warfare units.

This code is the source for a live website that can be used currently to track Retainers and Characters for D&D 5e, including the Stronghold and Followers rules published by MCDM, see: https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/strongholds-followers-pdf

## Using the website
The live website is currently hosted on my personal webserver at https://retainers.monkehh.com/

For most of the functionality of the site, you need to create a user account and log in.

*For a quick preview of what the site does, check out https://retainers.monkehh.com/quickretainercreator.php, a quick creator that doesn't require a log-on to use.*

Additional functionality available for registered Users:
  <li> Save and manage Retainers in a handy table.
  <li> Assign Retainers to characters, including access to a character's assigned retainers on their character sheet. 
  <li> A dynamic character sheet, linked to a backend that stores character resources and inventories across a server-side DB and in local storage on your browser.
